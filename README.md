## Introduction

The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic gaming console, but not all users speak the same language. This project is dedicated to providing homebrew translations for the Nintendo Switch firmware, making it more accessible and enjoyable for a global audience. Whether you want to play games or navigate the system in your native language, this project has you covered.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A Nintendo Switch console with custom firmware (CFW) or other means of running homebrew applications.
- Updated firmware to match translation version

### Installation

To install the translation:

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/NX-Family/NX-Translation/releases) section of this repository.
2. Download the translation files that match your desired language and firmware version.
3. Unpack the downloaded archive to your Nintendo Switch's SD card. Place the translation files in the appropriate directory, typically:
```SDCARD/
├── atmosphere/
│ └─────────── contents/
│ └─────────────────────[Translation Files]
├── ...
└── [Other Files and Folders]
```
4. Reboot your Nintendo Switch and select the target language to activate the translation.
